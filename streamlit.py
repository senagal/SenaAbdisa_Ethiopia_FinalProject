Dashboard: The Guardian Coverage of Ethiopia 1996-2021

Research questions:
  1. How has The Guardian coverage of Ethiopia changed over time?
  2. How has the sentiment of The Guardian articles on Ethiopia changed over time?
  3. Which topics dominate Ethiopia-related coverage?
  4. Do years with more focused coverage correspond to higher/lower
     tourist arrivals the following year?
  5. Do years with more negative coverage correspond to lower tourism
     the following year?
  6. Do years with more positive coverage correspond to higher tourism
     the following year?

### What is the Project's Objective?

This project started from a simple question: *"How are we being portrayed in international media? And does it have any tangible effect on our economy?"*

The main objective is to observe and analyse media coverage of Ethiopia in digital article sites and check if it has any correlation with the number of tourists we get.

Due to legal policies against obtaining information from most sites, this project is limited to **The Guardian** and all article-related information is analysed from data obtained through their official API. The tourist arrival data is obtained from Kaggle, by Mohamadreza Momeni, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/tourism?select=26-+international-arrivals-for-personal-vs-business-and-professional-reasons.csv).

    st.markdown("""
Articles were fetched from The Guardian's [Open Platform API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/), which provides free access to their full article archive. To use the fetch script yourself:

1. Register for a free API key at [open-platform.theguardian.com](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
2. Add it to a `.env` file in the project root: `GUARDIAN_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Run `python fetch_ethiopia.py`

The script queries for any article containing the words "Ethiopia", "Ethiopian", or "Ethiopians". To avoid hitting rate limits, it fetches in **30-day chunks** from 1996 to 2021, saving each chunk to `data/progress_ethiopia/` as it goes. This means if the script is interrupted, you can restart it and it will pick up from where it left off without re-fetching already-completed chunks.

Each article is saved with its headline, summary, body text, author, publication date, section, word count, and tags. Duplicate articles (same URL appearing in multiple chunks) are removed before the final file is written to `data/ethiopia_raw.json`.
    """)

    st.markdown("#### Article Labelling and Cleaning")
    st.markdown("""
Raw articles were then passed through `label_ethiopia.py`, which sends each article to gpt-5-mini for classification. Each article receives three labels:

- **is_focus** : whether Ethiopia is the primary subject of the article, or just mentioned in passing
- **topic** : the single bestmfitting topic from: Politics & Governance, Economy & Business, Sport & Football, Tourism & Culture, Health & Development, Conflict & Security, Environment & Climate, or Other
- **sentiment** : the overall sentiment of the article on Ethiopia: Positive, Neutral, or Negative

Articles are processed in batches of 10 and labelled year by year, with each year's results saved to `data/progress_labels_ethiopia/` so the script can be safely stopped and resumed without re-calling the API. The final labelled dataset is saved to `data/ethiopia_labelled.csv`.
    """)

    st.markdown("#### Tourist Arrivals Data")
    st.markdown("""
The tourism dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Tourism Dataset by Mohamadreza Momeni](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/tourism?select=26-+international-arrivals-for-personal-vs-business-and-professional-reasons.csv).

To obtain it:
1. Create a free Kaggle account at [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com)
2. Navigate to the dataset linked above
3. Download the file `26- international-arrivals-for-personal-vs-business-and-professional-reasons.csv`
4. Place it in the `data/` folder of this project

**Important note on the arrivals figure:** The dataset reports tourist arrivals split into personal and business/professional reasons. The total arrivals figure used in this project is the **combined total** of both personal and business visitors, as both contribute to the overall tourism footprint of the country.

During cleaning (`prepare_ethiopia.py`), the full dataset, which covers many countries, is filtered to **Ethiopia only**, and further narrowed to the years **1996 to 2021** to match The Guardian article data. Any rows with missing arrival counts are dropped. The cleaned tourism data is then merged with the article summary data (one row per year) to produce the final analysis file at `data/ethiopia_analysis.csv`.

Considering that most people do not visit a country right after they read about  it, rather they take time to explore further before doing we will be using a **one-year lag** so coverage in year **t** is compared with tourism in year **t+1**.

For the regression results using focused articles vs number of tourist arrivals, we have a slope of roughly 7859 with a p-value os 0.0011 which means that for an increase of 1 article focusing on Ethiopia, we see an increase of about 7859 tourist arrivals the following year. And since the p-value is less than 0.05, this positive association is statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to be due to random chance.
Same goes for total articles, we have a slope of roughly 1233 with a p-value well less than 0.05 which means that for an increase of 1 article mentioning Ethiopia, we see an increase of about 1233 tourist arrivals the following year. 
But does this mean that the more they write about us, the more tourists we get? Not necessarily. We can only say that there is a positive association between the two, but we cannot conclude causation from this analysis alone. There could be other factors at play, such as global events, economic conditions, or changes in travel trends that influence both media coverage and tourism independently. 
Also our source of articles is only The Guardian, which does not fully represent global media coverage. So while the association is interesting and suggests a potential link, we would need more comprehensive data and analysis to draw stronger conclusions about causality.
This is just a starting point for a project I have wanted to do for a while, and scaling it up to cover more articles from different sources and more factors would be a great next step to explore these relationships further.""")

Based on the number of negative articles vs number of tourists, the result seems to be opposite of what you would expect. The slope is roughly 7029 which would indicate that for an increase of 1 negative article there is an additional 7029 tourists visiting next year. But one point we have to consider is years with more negative coverage also tend to be years with more total coverage overall (as seen in Q4), and more coverage of any kind correlates with more tourism so it could be confounding the result.

So to check even further see the negative rate vs number of tourists graph, where negative rate is the number of negatively written articles divided by the total number of articles that year. As you can see, the slope of that graph is negative meaning the more the share of negative articles increases the fewer the number of visitors next year. But the p-value is well over 0.05, meaning the relationship is not statistically significant enough.

In short: **negative coverage alone does not appear to deter tourism** in this dataset, at least not in a way that is statistically separable from overall coverage volume.

The positive rate shows a weak and generally non-significant association with number of tourists in the following year when we see the positive rate vs number of tourist arrival graph. But the number of positive articles vs number of tourist arrivals shows a more significant association, with an increase of 1 positive article being correlated with an increase of roughly 16,168 tourist arrivals. But again this is likely driven by the correlation between volume of coverage and tourism seen in Q4.

This suggests that **it is the volume of coverage rather than its positivity that is associated with higher tourism**, at least within the range and source of data available here.

# ── Conclusion ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
with tabs[7]:
    st.header("Final Conclusions")
    st.markdown("""
This project set out to answer whether The Guardian's media coverage of Ethiopia is associated with how many tourists the country receives. Here is a summary of what was found:

| Question | Finding |
|---|---|
| Q1: Has coverage grown? | Yes, significantly. Both total and focused articles mostly trend upward over 1996-2021. |
| Q2: Has sentiment changed? | No. Sentiment is mostly mildly and consistently negative throughout, with no significant trend. But when observing the number of articles, most of them are written in a neutral tone. |
| Q3: Which topics dominate? | Politics & Governance and Conflict & Security dominate, with Health & Development following. |
| Q4: Does coverage volume predict tourism? | More coverage correlates with more arrivals the following year, but we can't fully determine causation due to the limitations of our dataset. |
| Q5: Does negative coverage deter tourism? | Not detectably. Negative rate alone does not show a significant negative effect based on our data. |
| Q6: Does positive coverage attract tourism? | Again not detectably beyond the effect of coverage volume overall. |

**The most important finding** is that overall coverage volume, regardless of sentiment, has the strongest correlation with next-year tourist arrivals in this dataset. This may reflect a simple awareness effect: the more Ethiopia appears in The Guardian, the more it is on the radar of potential visitors.

---
**Limitations to keep in mind:**
- All results show association, not causation. We cannot conclude The Guardian's articles caused the tourism arrivals.
- Data is limited to one outlet (The Guardian), which is only one site and does not fully represent global media at all.
- Simple linear regression does not control for confounding variables such as economic conditions, regional stability, or global travel trends.
- Tourism data combines personal and business arrivals, which may respond differently to media coverage.

---
**Next steps** that would strengthen this analysis:
- Expand to multiple news sources across different countries and languages.
- Include additional variables (GDP, flight routes, regional conflict indicators) in a multivariate model.
- Use more precise sentiment labelling criteria in the GPT prompt.
- Separate leisure from business tourism in the arrivals data.

This is a starting point for a project I have wanted to pursue for a while. The association between coverage and tourism is real and worth exploring further with richer data.
